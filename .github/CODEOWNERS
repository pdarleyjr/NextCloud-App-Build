# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @pdarleyjr will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @pdarleyjr

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @pdarleyjr and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js    @pdarleyjr

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
# *.go docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository.
# *.txt @pdarleyjr/reviewers

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# /docs/*  @pdarleyjr

# Add other patterns as needed
