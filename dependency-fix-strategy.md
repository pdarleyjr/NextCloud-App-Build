# Dependency Update Fix Strategy

## Issue Summary

Several dependabot PRs are failing CI checks due to compatibility issues with updated packages:

1. **PR #6**: Bump eslint-plugin-promise from 6.6.0 to 7.2.1
2. **PR #7**: Bump css-loader from 6.11.0 to 7.1.2
3. **PR #8**: Bump eslint from 8.57.1 to 9.22.0
4. **PR #9**: Bump webpack-cli from 5.1.4 to 6.0.1

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. css-loader 7.1.2 Compatibility (PR #7)

The css-loader 7.x has changed its default behavior with `modules.namedExport` being set to `true` by default.

**Fix**: Updated webpack.config.js to explicitly set `namedExport: false` to maintain backward compatibility.

```javascript
// In webpack.config.js
{
  loader: 'css-loader',
  options: {
    modules: {
      namedExport: false,
      localIdentName: '[name]__[local]--[hash:base64:5]'
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. ESLint 9.22.0 & eslint-plugin-promise 7.2.1 Compatibility (PRs #6 & #8)

The ESLint update to v9 and eslint-plugin-promise to v7 requires additional configuration.

**Fix**: Updated .eslintrc.js to include extended configurations and specific promise rules:

```javascript
// In .eslintrc.js
extends: [
  'eslint:recommended',
  'standard'
],
plugins: [
  'import',
  'n',
  'promise'
],
rules: {
  // Added promise rules:
  'promise/always-return': 'error',
  'promise/no-return-wrap': 'error',
  // ... additional promise rules ...
}
```

### 3. webpack-cli 6.0.1 Compatibility (PR #9)

webpack-cli 6.0.1 requires Node.js 18.12.0 or higher and has some changes in how exports are handled.

**Fix**:
1. Updated Node.js version in CI workflows from 18.19.0 to 20.x
2. Updated webpack.config.js exports to ensure compatibility

```javascript
// In webpack.config.js
const config = {
  // configuration settings
};

// For webpack-cli 6.0.1 compatibility
export default config;
export { config };
```

## Implementation Strategy

We created a script (`fix-failing-prs.sh`) that will:

1. Create a new branch for the fixes
2. Commit all changes with detailed commit messages
3. Push the branch to GitHub
4. Create a PR with a detailed description of the fixes

After the fix PR is merged, we can run `auto-merge-dependabot-prs.sh` to merge the now-fixed dependabot PRs.

## How to Use the Fix Script

1. Run the script to create a fix PR:

```bash
./fix-failing-prs.sh
```

2. Review and merge the created PR

3. After merging, you can use the auto-generated script to close the now-superseded PRs:

```bash
./close-superseded-prs.sh [new-pr-number]
```

4. Alternatively, rebase and merge the original dependabot PRs if desired:

```bash
./auto-merge-dependabot-prs.sh
```

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Consider setting stricter version constraints for critical dependencies
2. Add additional CI checks to test dependency compatibility before merging
3. Consider grouping related dependabot PRs together (which is already enabled in the dependabot.yml configuration)
4. Create integration tests that would catch breaking changes from dependencies
