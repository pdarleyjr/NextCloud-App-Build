Appointments
NextCloud-App-Build
original-appointments
- **Pending File Count:** 97
## Initial Assessment
- The repository has 97 pending files, not 20,000 as mentioned in the task. This suggests that someone has already cleaned up most of the pending files.
- The original Appointments repository is available at /workspaces/Appointments and /workspaces/original-appointments.
- Many files have already been staged for commit, including controller and service files.
## Action Plan
1. Recover any remaining missing files from the original Appointments repository
2. Add untracked files to git
3. Fix SCSS & CSS issues
4. Check and optimize polling & notification handling
5. Restart NextCloud and verify fixes
