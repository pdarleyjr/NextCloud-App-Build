# Browser Console Error Fixes for Nextcloud & GitHub Codespaces

This document provides an overview of the fixes implemented to resolve browser console errors in the Nextcloud application running in GitHub Codespaces.

## üîß Implemented Fixes

### 1. CSS Issues Fixed

- **Removed deprecated vendor prefixes** (`-moz-`, `-ms-`)
- **Fixed duplicate placeholder selectors** in form.scss
- **Corrected syntax errors** in color properties
- **Updated stylelint configuration** to better handle vendor prefixes and modern CSS

### 2. Resource Loading Errors Fixed

- **Updated Docker mounts** in devcontainer.json to correctly map theme resources
- **Created repair script** to scan and fix Nextcloud files
- **Added config.php** with proper theme configuration

### 3. Notification & Polling Performance Improved

- **Implemented WebSocket-based notifications** to replace inefficient polling
- **Used EventSource for server-sent events** for better reliability
- **Optimized session settings** in config.php

## üöÄ How to Use These Fixes

### Running the Repair Script

To fix resource loading errors:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/repair-nextcloud.sh
```

This script will:
- Repair Nextcloud files
- Scan all files
- Clear caches
- Verify theme resources
- Set up background jobs

### Validating CSS

To validate and fix CSS issues:

```bash
./scripts/validate-css.sh
```

This script will:
- Check for CSS errors using stylelint
- Offer to automatically fix issues
- Report validation results

### Enabling WebSocket Notifications

The WebSocket notification system is automatically included in the webpack build. To rebuild the application with this feature:

```bash
cd custom_apps/appointments
npm run build
```

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Checking for Console Errors

After implementing these fixes, you should see significantly fewer browser console errors. To verify:

1. Open your Nextcloud instance in the browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Check for any remaining errors

### Common Issues & Solutions

If you still encounter errors:

1. **Theme resource errors**:
   - Verify the Docker mounts in devcontainer.json
   - Run the repair script again

2. **CSS warnings**:
   - Run the validate-css.sh script
   - Check for any new CSS issues

3. **Notification polling errors**:
   - Ensure the WebSocket script is properly included
   - Check the config.php settings

## üìã GitHub Actions Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow has been added to automatically validate CSS on push and pull requests. This ensures that CSS issues are caught early in the development process.

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/lint-css.yml`.

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

To maintain a clean browser console:

1. Regularly run the validation scripts
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Follow Nextcloud coding standards
4. Use the GitHub Actions workflow for automated checks
